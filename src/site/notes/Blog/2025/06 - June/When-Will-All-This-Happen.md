### When Will All This Happen

This is part 3 of Jesus' End-Time Chronology as documented in Matthew 24. This article covers Jesus' response to the disciples' first question in Matthew 24:3 - "**When Will All This Happen?**"

#### When You See All These Things

- The Generation That Sees These Signs Begin, Will See ALL These Things Take Place

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:32-35**
>
> [**32**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm) Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near. 
>
> [**33**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-33.htm) So also, when you see all these things, you will know that He is near, right at the door. 
>
> [**34**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm) Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened. 
>
> [**35**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm) Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.

#### No One Knows the Day or Hour

- No Man Knows
- No Angel Knows
- Even Jesus Does Not Know
- ONLY The Father Knows

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:36**
>
> [**36**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm) No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

#### His Coming Will Be Like The Days Of Noah

- Banquets, Parties, Weddings
- The Day Comes Upon Them Unawares (Like A Thief In The Night)
- Two Men Working - One Taken, The Other Left
- Two Women Grinding - One Taken, The Other Left

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:37-41**
>
> [**37**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-37.htm) As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. 
>
> [**38**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-38.htm) For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark. 
>
> [**39**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-39.htm) And they were oblivious until the flood came and swept them all away. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. 
>
> [**40**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-40.htm) Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 
>
> [**41**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-41.htm) Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.

#### Multiple Warnings

- Keep Watch
- Be Ready
- Keep On The Alert
- Be Dressed For Service (Have the Armor of God On)
- Keep Awake

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:42-44**
>
> [**42**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-42.htm) Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day on which your Lord will come. 
>
> [**43**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm) But understand this: If the homeowner had known in which watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 
>
> [**44**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-44.htm) For this reason, you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.

> [!NOTE] **Mark 13: 33-37**
>
> [**32**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm) No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 
>
> [**33**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-33.htm) Be on your guard and stay alert. For you do not know when the appointed time will come.
>
> [**34**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-34.htm) It is like a man going on a journey who left his house, put each servant in charge of his own task, and instructed the doorkeeper to keep watch. 
>
> [**35**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-35.htm) Therefore keep watch, because you do not know when the master of the house will return—whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning. 
>
> [**36**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-36.htm) Otherwise, he may arrive without notice and find you sleeping. 
>
> [**37**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-37.htm) And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Keep watch!"

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:34-36**
>
> [**34**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm)But watch yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon you suddenly like a snare. 
>
> [**35**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-35.htm)For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of all the earth. 
>
> [**36**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-36.htm)So keep watch at all times, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man."

#### Additional Warnings

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:45-51**
>
> [**45**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-45.htm) Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household, to give the others their food at the proper time? 
>
> [**46**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-46.htm) Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. 
>
> [**47**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-47.htm) Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
>
> [**48**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-48.htm) But suppose that servant is wicked and says in his heart, 'My master will be away a long time.' 
>
> [**49**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-49.htm) And he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. 
>
> [**50**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-50.htm) The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate. 
>
> [**51**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-51.htm) Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

> [!NOTE] **Luke 12:36-38**
>
> [**36**](https://biblehub.com/luke/12-36.htm) Then you will be like servants waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks, they can open the door for him at once. 
>
> [**37**](https://biblehub.com/luke/12-37.htm) Blessed are those servants whom the master finds on watch when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve and will have them recline at the table, and he himself will come and wait on them. 
>
> [**38**](https://biblehub.com/luke/12-38.htm) Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them alert, those servants will be blessed.

> [!NOTE]  
> Notice in Matthew there is both a blessing and a condemnation with respect to being alert and prepared for Jesus' return. Those who are alert and going about the business of the Kingdom will be blessed. While those who become lazy, and abusive of fellow believers will not only be surprised by Jesus' coming, but will suffer the same fate as unbelievers and hypocrites.
>
> And in Luke Jesus Himself will dress Himself to serve and will have those who endure until the end to recline at His table, and He will wait upon them. His blessing will be upon them.
