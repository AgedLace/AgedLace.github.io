### What Sign Will Signal Your Return?

This is part 2 of Jesus' End-Time Chronology as documented in Matthew 24. This article covers Jesus' response to the disciples' second question in Matthew 24:3 - "**What Sign Will Signal Your Return?**"

- Abomination of Desolation In the Temple
- Greatest Tribulation Since the World Began
- Those Days Will Be Cut Short For The Sake Of The Elect
- Miracle Working False Messiahs and False Prophets
- Strong Deception
- His Coming Is As Lightning Comes From The East And Flashes As Far As The West

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:15-28**
>
> [**15**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm) So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination of desolation,'[a](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/24.htm#fn) spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand),
>
> [**16**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-16.htm) then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
>
> [**17**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-17.htm) Let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve anything from his house.
>
> [**18**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-18.htm) And let no one in the field return for his cloak.
>
> [**19**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-19.htm) How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers!
>
> [**20**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-20.htm)  Pray that your flight will not occur in the winter or on the Sabbath.
>
> [**21**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm) For at that time there will be great tribulation, unseen from the beginning of the world until now, and never to be seen again. 
>
> [**22**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm) If those days had not been cut short, nobody would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be cut short.
>
> [**23**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-23.htm) At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There He is!' do not believe it.
>
> [**24**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm) For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive even the elect, if that were possible.
>
> [**25**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-25.htm) See, I have told you in advance.
>
> [**26**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-26.htm) So if they tell you, 'There He is, in the wilderness,' do not go out, or, 'Here He is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
>
> [**27**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-27.htm) For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
>
> [**28**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm) Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.

Luke 21 adds the following perspective …

- Jerusalem Surrounded By Armies
- The Days Of God's Vengeance In Order To Fulfill Prophecy
- Disaster In The Land (of Israel)
- Great Distress Upon the Land
- Wrath Upon the People

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:20-24**
>
> [**20**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm) But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near.
>
> [**21**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-21.htm) Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city.
>
> [**22**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-22.htm) For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.
>
> [**23**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-23.htm) "Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people; 
>
> [**24**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm) How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people.

#### Immediately After The Tribulation

- Sun Will Be Darkened
- Moon Will Give No Light
- Stars Fall From Sky
- Powers In Heaven Shaken

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:29**
>
> [**29**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm) "But **immediately after the tribulation of those days** THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

> [!NOTE] **Mark 13:24-25**
>
> [**24**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm) But in those days, after that tribulation: 'The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;
>
> [**25**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-25.htm) the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.'

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:25**
>
> [**25**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm) There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves.

Please **compare Matthew 24:29, Mark 13:24-25, and Luke 21:25 with Revelation 6:12-14**.

> [!NOTE] **Revelation 6:12-14**
>
> [**12**](https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm) And I watched as the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair, and the whole moon turned blood red, 
>
> [**13**](https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-13.htm) and the stars of the sky fell to the earth like unripe figs dropping from a tree shaken by a great wind. 
>
> [**14**](https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm) The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.

#### **THEN** The Sign Of The Son Of Man

- Jesus' Sign Appears In The Heavens
- All the Earth Will Mourn When They See Him
- Jesus Comes On The Clouds of Heaven
- Angels Sent Out At Trumpet Blast
- The Elect Are Gathered From The Heavens
	- Matthew says, "from one end of the heavens to the other"
	- Mark says, "from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heaven."

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:30-31**
>
> [**30**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm) At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
>
> [**31**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm) And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

> [!NOTE] **Mark 13:26-27**
>
> [**26**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-26.htm) At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 
>
> [**27**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-27.htm) And He will send out the angels to gather His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.

> [!NOTE]  
> These passages very clearly refute the false doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture. The gathering of Christ's Elect happens when He returns **after** the Great Tribulation of those days.  

Luke 21:26-27 adds …

- Men Fainting From Fear And Anxiety of What Is Coming
- Powers of the Heavens Will Be Shaken
- They Will See Son of Man Coming In A Cloud

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:26-27**
>
> [**26**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-26.htm) Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
>
> [**27**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-27.htm) At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

#### What Jesus Said Our Attitude Should Be

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:28**
>
> [**28**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-28.htm) When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
