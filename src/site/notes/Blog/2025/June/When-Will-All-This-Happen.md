### When Will All This Happen

This is part 3 of Jesus' End-Time Chronology as documented in Matthew 24. This article covers Jesus' response to the disciples' first question in Matthew 24:3 - "**When Will All This Happen?**"

#### When You See All These Things

- The Generation That Sees These Signs Begin, Will See ALL These Things Take Place

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:32-35**
>
> [**32**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm) "Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near; 
>
> [**33**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-33.htm) so, you too, **when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, right at the door**. 
>
> [**34**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm) "Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until **all** these things take place. 
>
> [**35**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm) "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.

#### No One Knows the Day or Hour

- No Man Knows
- No Angel Knows
- Even Jesus Does Not Know
- ONLY The Father Knows

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:36**
>
> [**36**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm) "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.

#### His Coming Will Be Like The Days Of Noah

- Banquets, Parties, Weddings
- Two Men Working - One Taken, The Other Left
- Two Women Grinding - One Taken, The Other Left

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:37-41**
>
> [**37**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-37.htm) "For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. 
>
> [**38**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-38.htm) "For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 
>
> [**39**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-39.htm) and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be. 
>
> [**40**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-40.htm) "Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. 
>
> [**41**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-41.htm) "Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.

#### Multiple Warnings

- Be on the Alert
- Be Ready

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:42-44**
>
> [**42**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-42.htm) "Therefore **be on the aler**t, for **you do not know which day** your Lord is coming. 
>
> [**43**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm) "But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 
>
> [**44**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-44.htm) "For this reason **you also must be ready**; for the Son of Man is coming **at an hour when you do not think He will**.

**Mark 13: 33-37**

[**33**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-33.htm) "**Take heed, keep on the alert**; for you do not know when the appointed time will come. 

[**34**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-34.htm) "It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert. 

[**35**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-35.htm) "Therefore, **be on the aler**t—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning— 

[**36**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-36.htm) in case he should come suddenly and find you asleep. 

[**37**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-37.htm) "What I say to you I say to all, **'Be on the alert!'**"

Luke 21:34-36 adds …

- Be On Guard
- Don't Let Day Catch You Unaware
- That Day Comes Upon The Whole Earth
- Keep Alert
- Pray To Be Strong Enough To Escape And To Stand Before The Son of Man

**Luke 21:34-36**

[**34**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm) "**Be on guard**, so that your hearts will not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap; 

[**35**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-35.htm) for it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth. 

[**36**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-36.htm) "But **keep on the alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."**

#### Additional Warnings In Matthew 24

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:45-51**
>
> [**45**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-45.htm) "Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time? 
>
> [**46**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-46.htm) "**Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes**. 
>
> [**47**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-47.htm) "Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
>
> [**48**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-48.htm) "But if that evil slave says in his heart, 'My master is not coming for a long time,' 
>
> [**49**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-49.htm) and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards; 
>
> [**50**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-50.htm) **the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know,** 
>
> [**51**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-51.htm) and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Notice that there is both a blessing and a condemnation with respect to being alert and prepared for Jesus' return.  
>
> Those who are alert and going about the business of the Kingdom will be blessed.  
>
> While those who become lazy, and abusive of fellow believers will not only be surprised by Jesus' coming, but will suffer the same fate as unbelievers and hypocrites.  

This concludes our 3 part series of Jesus' End-Time Chronology.
