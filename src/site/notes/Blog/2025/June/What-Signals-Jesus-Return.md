### What Sign Will Signal Your Return?

This is part 2 of Jesus' End-Time Chronology as documented in Matthew 24. This article covers Jesus' response to the disciples' second question in Matthew 24:3 - "**What Sign Will Signal Your Return?**"

- Abomination of Desolation In the Temple
- Worst (Greatest) Tribulation Since the World Began
- Time of Calamity Shortened For The Sake Of The Elect
- Miracle Working False Messiahs and False Prophets
- **Strong** Deception
- His Coming Is As Lightning

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:15-28**
>
> [**15**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm) "Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 
>
> [**16**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-16.htm) then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. 
>
> [**17**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-17.htm) "Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house. 
>
> [**18**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-18.htm) "Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 
>
> [**19**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-19.htm) "But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 
>
> [**20**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-20.htm) "But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath. 
>
> [**21**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm) "For **then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever wilL**. 
>
> [**22**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm) "Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 
>
> [**23**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-23.htm) "Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or 'There He is,' do not believe him. 
>
> [**24**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm) "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect. 
>
> [**25**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-25.htm) "Behold, I have told you in advance. 
>
> [**26**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-26.htm) "So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out, or, 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe them. 
>
> [**27**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-27.htm) "For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. 
>
> [**28**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm) "Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.

Luke 21 adds the following perspective …

- Jerusalem Surrounded By Armies
- Days Of God's Vengeance
- Disaster In The Land (of Israel)
- Great Distress Upon the Land
- Great Wrath Upon Israel
- People Killed or Taken Captive
- Jerusalem Trampled Down By Gentiles - Time Of The Gentiles

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:20-24**
>
> [**20**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm) "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near. 
>
> [**21**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-21.htm) "Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city; 
>
> [**22**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-22.htm) because these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written will be fulfilled. 
>
> [**23**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-23.htm) "Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people; 
>
> [**24**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm) and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

#### Immediately After The Tribulation

- Sun Will Be Darkened
- Moon Will Give No Light
- Stars Fall From Sky
- Powers In Heaven Shaken

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:29**
>
> [**29**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm) "But **immediately after the tribulation of those days** THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

Please **compare Matthew 24:29 with Revelation 6:12-14**.

> [!NOTE] **Revelation 6:12-14**
>
> [**12**](https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm) And I watched as the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair, and the whole moon turned blood red, 
>
> [**13**](https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-13.htm) and the stars of the sky fell to the earth like unripe figs dropping from a tree shaken by a great wind. 
>
> [**14**](https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm) The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.

#### **THEN** The Sign Of The Son Of Man

- Jesus' Sign Appears In The Heavens
- All the Earth Will Mourn When They See Him
- Jesus Comes On The Clouds of Heaven
- Angels Sent Out At Trumpet Blast
- The Elect Are Gathered From Heaven and Earth

> [!NOTE] **Matthew 24:30-31**
>
> [**30**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm) "And **THEN the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky**, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory. 
>
> [**31**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm) "**And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.**

> [!NOTE] **Mark 13:24
>
> [**24**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm) "But in those days, **after that tribulation**, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, 
>
> [**25**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-25.htm) AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. 
>
> [**26**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-26.htm) "Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory. 
>
> [**27**](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-27.htm) "And **THEN He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.**

> [!NOTE]  
> These passages very clearly refute the false doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture. The gathering of Christ's Elect happens when He returns **after** the Great Tribulation of those days.  

Luke 21:25-27 adds …

- Signs in the Sun, Moon and Stars
- Great Dismay On The Earth Due To Roaring of the Sea and Waves
- Men Fainting From Fear And Expectation of What Is Coming
- Powers of the Heavens Will Be Shaken
- They Will See Son of Man Coming In A Cloud

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:25-27**
>
> [**25**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm) "There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves, 
>
> [**26**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-26.htm) men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
>
> [**27**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-27.htm) "Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD with power and great glory. 

#### What Jesus Said Our Attitude Should Be

> [!NOTE] **Luke 21:28**
>
> [**28**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-28.htm) "But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
