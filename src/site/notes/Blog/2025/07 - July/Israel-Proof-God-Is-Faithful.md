## Why This Post

Recently, I have been witnessing an increasingly heated, even volatile, 'discussion' dividing the Body of Christ with respect to Israel; particularly "who is the 'real' Israel. These 'discussions' have quite literally devolved into both sides name-calling, and even accusing the other of being "antichrist".  

I have been praying and asking God about this. As I was waking up today, I had the thought how God has never called Christians "to return" to His land. Rather, He has brought back the biological descendants (yet another bitterly contested topic) of Abraham, just as He promised by covenant to him.

> [!NOTE] **Genesis 12:7**

> [**7**](https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm) Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to your offspring." So Abram built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.

In the meantime, I am in the process of gathering my resources for diving into the question of "[[Who Is Israel\|Who Is Israel]]?". It is a vast topic that will take a great deal of time to sift, and pray, through. I don't know when this new project will be completed, as I am also working on a series of posts aimed at new believers in Christ.  

I just wanted to get this revelation down so that I didn't forget it.
