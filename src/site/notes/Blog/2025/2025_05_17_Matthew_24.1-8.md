**Temple Destruction and Other Signs**<br/>
([Mark 13:1–8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/mark/13.htm); [Luke 21:5–9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/21.htm#5))

[**1**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-1.htm) As [[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Jesus/Index\|Jesus]] left [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Prophecy/Temple-Destroyed\|the temple]] and was walking away, His [[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Disciples/Ask-3-Questions\|disciples]] came up to Him to point out its buildings.

[**2**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-2.htm) "Do you see all these things?" He replied. "Truly I tell you, [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Prophecy/Temple-Destroyed\|not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down]]."

[**3**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm) While [[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Jesus/Index\|Jesus]] was sitting on the [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Places/Mount-of-Olives\|Mount of Olives]], the [[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Disciples/Ask-3-Questions\|disciples]] came to Him privately. "Tell us," they said, "[[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Disciples/Ask-3-Questions\|when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?]]"

[**4**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-4.htm) [[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Jesus/Index\|Jesus]] answered, "[[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Believers/Commanded/See-To-It\|See to it]] that no one deceives you. [**5**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm) For [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Topics/False-Christs/Matthew_24v5\|many will come in My name]], claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Topics/Deception/Matthew_24v4\|will deceive many]]. [**6**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-6.htm) You will hear of [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Events/End-Time/Birth-Pain-Signs\|wars and rumors of wars]], but [[Bible-Study-Notebook/People/Believers/Commanded/See-To-It\|see to it]] that you are not alarmed. These things must happen, but [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Events/End-Time/The-End\|the end is still to come]]. [**7**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-7.htm) [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Events/End-Time/Birth-Pain-Signs\|Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom]]. There will be [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Events/End-Time/Birth-Pain-Signs\|famines and earthquakes in various places]]. [**8**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-8.htm) All these are [[Bible-Study-Notebook/Events/End-Time/Birth-Pain-Signs\|the beginning of birth pains]].
