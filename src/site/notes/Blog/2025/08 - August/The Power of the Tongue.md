In these last days, when deception abounds, Scripture commands us to guard our tongues and speak God’s Truth boldly.

## The Tongue’s Power  

>[!Bible] [Proverbs 18:21 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/PRO.18.21)
>Life and death are in the power of the tongue,
>and those who love it will eat its fruit.

- Do our words bring life or death?

>[!Bible] [Psalm 141:3 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/PSA.141.3)
>Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth;
>keep watch at the door of my lips.

- Only God can tame our speech.
 
 ## What We Speak Reflects What Is In Our Hearts  

>[!Bible] [Matthew 12:34-35 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/MAT.12.34-35)
>You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks. The good man brings good things out of his good store of treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil store of treasure.

- What do my words reveal is in my heart?


>[!Bible] [Proverbs 10:11 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/PRO.10.11)
>The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
>but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.

- Are my words righteous?
- Does my speech flow from a godly heart?

>[!Bible] [Psalm 19:14 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/PSA.19.14)
>May the words of my mouth
>and the meditation of my heart
>be pleasing in Your sight,
>O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.

- Do my heart and words please God?
## The Tongue Proclaims Truth

>[!Bible] [Proverbs 12:17 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/PRO.12.17)
>He who speaks the truth declares what is right,
>but a false witness speaks deceit.

- Do my words reflect the Truth of God's Word? 
- Or am I bearing false witness to it?

>[!Bible] [Ephesians 4:29 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/EPH.4.29)
>Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building up the one in need and bringing grace to those who listen.

- Do I edify others?
- Or do I tear them down?  

>[!Bible] [James 1:26 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/JAS.1.26)
>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not bridle his tongue, he deceives his heart and his religion is worthless.

- Does my walk reflect a bridled tongue?
- Is my heart deceiving me?
- Is my testimony worthless?

## Confess God's Word Daily


>[!Bible] [Romans 12:1-2 BSB](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/ROM.12.1-2)
>Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.

Daily speaking the following proclamations based upon the Scriptures out loud will begin renewing your mind to align your tongue with God’s Word.

> My tongue speaks life, bearing fruit for God (Proverbs 18:21, BSB).

> My words flow from a heart filled with Your truth, O Lord (Matthew 12:34-35, BSB).

> Guard my mouth, O LORD, that my words bring life (Psalm 141:3, Proverbs 10:11, BSB).

> Let my words and heart please You, my Redeemer (Psalm 19:14, BSB).

> I speak truth to declare righteousness and edify others (Proverbs 12:17, Ephesians 4:29, BSB).

> I rein my tongue, proving my faith true (James 1:26, BSB).

Speak God's Truth in love. Edify others. Stand firm in these last days.
