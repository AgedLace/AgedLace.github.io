**The Abomination of Desolation** 
([Matthew 24:15–25](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm%2315); [Luke 21:20–24](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F21.htm%2320))

[14](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-14.htm) So when you see the abomination of desolation[a](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F%23fn) standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. [15](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-15.htm) Let no one on the housetop go back inside to retrieve anything from his house. [16](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-16.htm) And let no one in the field return for his cloak.

[17](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-17.htm) How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! [18](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-18.htm) Pray that this will not occur in the winter. [19](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-19.htm) For those will be days of tribulation unseen from the beginning of God's creation until now, and never to be seen again. [20](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-20.htm) If the Lord had not cut short those days, nobody would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom He has chosen, He has cut them short.

[21](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-21.htm) At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There He is!' do not believe it. [22](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-22.htm) For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive even the elect, if that were possible. [23](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-23.htm) So be on your guard; I have told you everything in advance.
