**The Return of the Son of Man**<br/>
([Matthew 24:26–31](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm%2326); [Luke 21:25–28](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F21.htm%2325))

[24](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-24.htm) But in those days, after that tribulation:

'The sun will be darkened,

and the moon will not give its light;

[25](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-25.htm) the stars will fall from the sky,

and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

[26](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-26.htm) At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.[d](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F%23fn) [27](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-27.htm) And He will send out the angels to gather His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
