**Readiness at Any Hour**<br/>
([Matthew 24:36–51](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm%2336); [Luke 12:35–48](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F12.htm%2335))

[32](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-32.htm) No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. [33](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-33.htm) Be on your guard and stay alert For you do not know when the appointed time will come.

[34](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-34.htm) It is like a man going on a journey who left his house, put each servant in charge of his own task, and instructed the doorkeeper to keep watch. [35](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-35.htm) Therefore keep watch, because you do not know when the master of the house will return—whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning. [36](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-36.htm) Otherwise, he may arrive without notice and find you sleeping. [37](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-37.htm) And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Keep watch!"
