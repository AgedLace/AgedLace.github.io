**Temple Destruction and Other Signs**<br/>
([Matthew 24:1–8](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm); [Luke 21:5–9](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F21.htm%235))

[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-1.htm) As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, "Teacher, look at the magnificent stones and buildings!"

[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-2.htm)" Do you see all these great buildings?" Jesus replied. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."

[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-3.htm) While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately, [4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-4.htm) "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?"

[5](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-5.htm) Jesus began by telling them, "See to it that no one deceives you. [6](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-6.htm) Many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am He,' and will deceive many. [7](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-7.htm) When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come. [8](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmark%2F13-8.htm) Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, as well as famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.
