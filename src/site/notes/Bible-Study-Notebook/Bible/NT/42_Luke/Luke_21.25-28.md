**The Return of the Son of Man** 
([Matthew 24:26–31](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm%2326); [Mark 13:24–27](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F13.htm%2324))

[25](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-25.htm) There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves. [26](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-26.htm) Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. [27](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-27.htm) At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.[b](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F%23fn) [28](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-28.htm) When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.
