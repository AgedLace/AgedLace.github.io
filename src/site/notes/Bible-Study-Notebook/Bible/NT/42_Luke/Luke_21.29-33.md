**The Lesson of the Fig Tree**<br/>
([Matthew 24:32–35](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm%2332); [Mark 13:28–31](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F13.htm%2328))

[29](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-29.htm) Then Jesus told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees. [30](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-30.htm) When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. [31](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-31.htm) So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. [32](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-32.htm) Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened. [33](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-33.htm) Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.
