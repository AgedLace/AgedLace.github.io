**The Destruction of Jerusalem**  
([Matthew 24:15–25](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/24.htm#15); [Mark 13:14–23](https://biblehub.com/bsb/mark/13.htm#14))

[**20**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm) But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near. [**21**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-21.htm) Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city. [**22**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-22.htm) For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.

[**23**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-23.htm) How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people. [**24**](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm) They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
