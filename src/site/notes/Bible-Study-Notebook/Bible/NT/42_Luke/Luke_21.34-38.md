**Be Watchful for the Day**

[34](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-34.htm) But watch yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon you suddenly like a snare. [35](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-35.htm) For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of all the earth. [36](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-36.htm) So keep watch at all times, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man."

[37](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-37.htm) Every day Jesus taught at the temple, but every evening He went out to spend the night on the Mount of Olives. [38](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-38.htm) And early in the morning all the people would come to hear Him at the temple.
