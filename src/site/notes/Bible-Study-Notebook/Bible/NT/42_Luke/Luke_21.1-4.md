**The Poor Widow's Offering**  
([Mark 12:41–44](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F12.htm%2341))

[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-1.htm) Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, [2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-2.htm) and He saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.[a](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F%23fn)

[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-3.htm) "Truly I tell you," He said, "this poor widow has put in more than all the others. [4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-4.htm) For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on."
