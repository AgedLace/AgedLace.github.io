**Temple Destruction and Other Signs** 
([Matthew 24:1–8](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm); [Mark 13:1–8](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F13.htm))

[5](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-5.htm) As some of the disciples were remarking how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated gifts, Jesus said, [6](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-6.htm) "As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."

[7](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-7.htm) "Teacher," they asked, "when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"

[8](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-8.htm) Jesus answered, "See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am He,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them. [9](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-9.htm) When you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be alarmed. These things must happen first, but the end is not imminent."
