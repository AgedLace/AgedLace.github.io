**Witnessing to All Nations**<br/>
([Matthew 24:9–14](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm%239); [Mark 13:9–13](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F13.htm%239))

[10](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-10.htm) Then He told them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. [11](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-11.htm) There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven.

[12](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-12.htm) But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors. [13](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-13.htm) This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses. [14](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-14.htm) So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves. [15](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-15.htm) For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.

[16](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-16.htm) You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death. [17](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-17.htm) And you will be hated by everyone because of My name. [18](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-18.htm) Yet not even a hair of your head will perish. [19](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fluke%2F21-19.htm) By your patient endurance you will gain your souls.
