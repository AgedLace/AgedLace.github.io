**The Lesson of the Fig Tree** 
([Mark 13:28–31](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F13.htm%2328); [Luke 21:29–33](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F21.htm%2329))

[32](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-32.htm) Now learn this lesson[e](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F%23fn) from the fig tree: As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near. [33](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-33.htm) So also, when you see all these things, you will know that He is near,[f](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F%23fn) right at the door. [34](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-34.htm) Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened. [35](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-35.htm) Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.
