The Return of the Son of Man 

([Mark 13:24–27](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F13.htm%2324); [Luke 21:25–28](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F21.htm%2325))

[26](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-26.htm) So if they tell you, 'There He is, in the wilderness,' do not go out, or, 'Here He is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. [27](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-27.htm) For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [28](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-28.htm) Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.

[29](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-29.htm) Immediately after the tribulation of those days:

'The sun will be darkened,

and the moon will not give its light;

the stars will fall from the sky,

and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.[b](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F%23fn)'

[30](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-30.htm) At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven,[c](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F%23fn) and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.[d](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F%23fn) [31](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-31.htm) And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
