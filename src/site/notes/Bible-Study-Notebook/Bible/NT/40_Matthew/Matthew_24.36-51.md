**Readiness at Any Hour**<br/>
([Genesis 6:1–7](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fgenesis%2F6.htm); [Mark 13:32–37](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmark%2F13.htm%2332); [Luke 12:35–48](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fluke%2F12.htm%2335))

[36](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-36.htm) No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,[g](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fbsb%2Fmatthew%2F%23fn) but only the Father. [37](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-37.htm) As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. [38](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-38.htm) For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark. [39](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-39.htm) And they were oblivious until the flood came and swept them all away. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. [40](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-40.htm) Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. [41](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-41.htm) Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.

[42](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-42.htm) Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day on which your Lord will come. [43](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-43.htm) But understand this: If the homeowner had known in which watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. [44](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-44.htm) For this reason, you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.

[45](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-45.htm) Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household, to give the others their food at the proper time? [46](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-46.htm) Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. [47](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-47.htm) Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.

[48](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-48.htm) But suppose that servant is wicked and says in his heart, 'My master will be away a long time.' [49](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-49.htm) And he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. [50](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-50.htm) The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate. [51](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fmatthew%2F24-51.htm) Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
