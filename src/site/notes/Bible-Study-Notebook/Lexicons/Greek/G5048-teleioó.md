The term **can refer to the fulfillment of a task, the completion of a journey, or the perfection of character.**

## Helps Word-studies

**Cognate: 5048** *teleióō* – to consummate, reaching the *end-stage*, i.e. **working through the entire process (stages) to reach the *final* phase (*conclusion***). [See 5056](https://biblehub.com/greek/5056.htm) (*telos*).

This root (*tel-*) means "reaching the *end* (*aim*)." It is well-illustrated with the old pirate's telescope, unfolding (extending out) one stage at a time to function at full-strength (capacity effectiveness).
