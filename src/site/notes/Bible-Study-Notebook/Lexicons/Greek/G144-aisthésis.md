## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - Perception, discernment, insight

**Word Origin** - Derived from *αἰσθάνομαι (aisthanomai)*, meaning "*to perceive*" or "*to discern*."

**Usage** - In the New Testament, "*aisthésis*" refers to the ability to perceive or discern, particularly in a moral or spiritual sense. It involves a deep understanding and insight that goes beyond mere knowledge, allowing one to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil. This discernment is often associated with spiritual maturity and wisdom.

## Helps Word-studies

**Cognate: 144** *aísthēsis* (a *feminine* noun) – properly, the brand of *sense*-discernment which "cuts through" hazy ethical (moral) matters to really "size things up" (**used only in Phil 1:9**). [See 145](https://biblehub.com/greek/145.htm) (*aisthētērion*).
