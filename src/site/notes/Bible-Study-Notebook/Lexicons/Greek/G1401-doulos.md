## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - servant, slave, bondservant

**Word Origin** - Derived from the root verb *δέω (deo)*, meaning "*to bind*."

**Usage** - The term "*doulos*" in the New Testament is used to describe a person who is in a position of servitude or subjection. It can refer to a literal slave, someone who is legally owned by another and whose entire livelihood and purpose are determined by their master. However, it is also used metaphorically to describe a person who is devoted to another to the disregard of their own interests, often used to describe followers of Christ who are committed to serving God and His purposes.

## Helps Word-studies

**1401** *doúlos* (a masculine noun of uncertain derivation) – properly, someone who belongs to another; a *bond-slave*, without *any ownership rights* of their own. Ironically, [1401](https://biblehub.com/greek/1401.htm) */doúlos* ("bond-slave") is used with the *highest dignity* in the NT – namely, of believers who *willingly* live under Christ's authority as His devoted followers.
