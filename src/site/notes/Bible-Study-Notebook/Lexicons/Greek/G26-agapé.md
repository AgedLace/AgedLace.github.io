## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - love

**Word Origin** - Derived from the verb *ἀγαπάω (agapaō)*, meaning "*to love*."

**Usage** - *Agapé* is a term used in the New Testament to describe a selfless, sacrificial, unconditional love. It is the highest form of love, often associated with the love of God for humanity and the love that believers are called to have for one another. Unlike other Greek words for love, such as "*eros*" (romantic love) or "*philia*" (brotherly love), *agapé* is not based on emotions or feelings but is an act of the will, characterized by a commitment to the well-being of others
