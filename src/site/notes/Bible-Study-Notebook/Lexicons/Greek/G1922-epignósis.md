## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - Knowledge, full knowledge, discernment, recognition

**Word Origin** - From the Greek preposition *ἐπί (epi*, meaning "*upon*" or "*toward*") and *γνῶσις (gnosis*, meaning "*knowledge*").

**Usage** - The term "*epignósis*" refers to a deep, thorough, and precise knowledge. It **implies a full understanding or discernment that goes beyond mere factual awareness**. In the New Testament, it often denotes a spiritual or moral insight that is **granted by God**, particularly in the context of knowing Christ and His will.

## Helps Word-studies

**Cognate: 1922** *epígnōsis* (from [1909](https://biblehub.com/greek/1909.htm) */epí*, "*on*, fitting" which intensifies [1108](https://biblehub.com/greek/1108.htm) */gnṓsis*, "**knowledge gained through first-hand relationship**") – properly, "**contact-knowledge**" that is appropriate ("apt, fitting") to first-hand, experiential knowing. This is defined by the individual context. [See 1921](https://biblehub.com/greek/1921.htm) (*epignōskō*).
