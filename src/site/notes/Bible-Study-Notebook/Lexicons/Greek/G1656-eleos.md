## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - mercy, compassion, pity

**Word Origin** - Derived from the Greek verb *ἐλεέω (eleeō)*, meaning "*to show mercy*" or "*to have compassion*."

**Usage** - In the New Testament, "*eleos*" refers to the compassionate treatment of those in distress, especially when it is within one's power to punish or harm. It is often used to describe God's mercy towards humanity, as well as the expected mercy believers should show to one another. The term encompasses both the feeling of compassion and the action that results from it.
