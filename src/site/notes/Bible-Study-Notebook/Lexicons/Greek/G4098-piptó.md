## Strong's Exhaustive Concordance

fail, fall down

A reduplicated and contracted form of *peto* (pet'-o); (which occurs only as an alternate in certain tenses); probably akin to *[petomai](https://biblehub.com/greek/4072.htm)* through the idea of alighting; to fall (literally or figuratively) -- fail, fall (down), light on.
