**Shipwrecked Faith**

> [!NOTE] **1 Timothy 1:18-20**
>
> 18 Timothy, my child, I entrust you with this command in keeping with the previous prophecies about you, so that by them you may fight the good fight,
>
> 19 holding on to faith and a good conscience, **which some have rejected and threby shipwrecked their faith.**
>
> 20 Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.

**Note**

One can '*shipwreck*' one's faith unless there was a period of time when they had faith to shipwreck.
