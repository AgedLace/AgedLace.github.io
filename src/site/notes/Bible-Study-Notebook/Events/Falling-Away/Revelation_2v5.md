**Jesus Told The Church At Ephesus to 'Return to Your First Love'**
**Jesus Said If They Did Not Repent, Their Lampstand Would Be Removed**

> [!NOTE] **Revelation 2:4-5**
> 4 But I have this against you: **You have abandoned your first love**.

 5 Therefore, **keep in mind how far you have fallen.** Repent and perform the deeds you did at first. But if you do not repent, **I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.**

**abandoned**

## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - To send away, to leave, to forgive, to permit, to abandon

**Word Origin** - Derived from *ἀπό* (*apo*, meaning "*from*") and *ἵημι* (*hiēmi*, meaning "*to send*" or "*to let go*").

**Usage** - The term *ἀφίημι* is used in various contexts in the New Testament, often translated as "*forgive*" in the context of sins or debts, **"*leave*" in the context of departing or abandoning**, and "*permit*" in the context of allowing something to happen.

## Helps Word-studies

**63** *aphíēmi* (from [575](https://biblehub.com/greek/575.htm) */apó*, "away from" and *hiēmi*, "send")–properly, *send away*; *release* (discharge).

The Greek word Jesus used for *abandoned* confirms that some in Ephesus who were once believers at some point turned away from, and left, their first love.  

**have fallen**

## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - To fall, to descend, to perish, to fail

**Word Origin** - A primary verb

**Usage** - The verb *πίπτω* is used in various contexts in the New Testament, often describing physical falling, but also metaphorically to indicate spiritual or moral failure, judgment, or destruction

## Strong's Exhaustive Concordance

fail, fall down

A reduplicated and contracted form of *peto* (pet'-o); (which occurs only as an alternate in certain tenses); probably akin to *[petomai](https://biblehub.com/greek/4072.htm)* through the idea of alighting; to fall (literally or figuratively) -- fail, fall (down), light on.

see GREEK *[petomai](https://biblehub.com/greek/4072.htm)*

Jesus' words clearly reveal that one-time believers are capable of abandoning, and falling away from, their faith, and in fact, were in danger of having their lampstand removed.
