**Jesus Told The Church At Ephesus to 'Return to Your First Love'**
**Jesus Said If They Did Not Repent, Their Lampstand Would Be Removed**

> [!NOTE] **Revelation 2:4-5**
> 4 But I have this against you: **You have abandoned your first love**.

 5 Therefore, **keep in mind how far you have fallen.** Repent and perform the deeds you did at first. But if you do not repent, **I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.**

**abandoned**
- ![[G863-aphiémi]]
The Greek word Jesus used for *abandoned* confirms that some in Ephesus who were once believers at some point turned away from, and left, their first love.  

**have fallen**
- ![[G4098-piptó]]
Jesus' words clearly reveal that one-time believers are capable of abandoning, and falling away from, their faith, and in fact, were in danger of having their lampstand removed.
