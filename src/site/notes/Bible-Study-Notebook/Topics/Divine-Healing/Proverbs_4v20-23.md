**Usage** - The verb *קָשַׁב* is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe the act of listening attentively or giving heed to something. It often implies an **active and intentional listening**, where one is not merely hearing but is also prepared to respond or act upon what is heard.

**Context** - The Hebrew verb *קָשַׁב* appears in various contexts throughout the Old Testament, often in relation to God or His commands.

- In the Psalms, *קָשַׁב* is frequently used in prayers where the psalmist asks God to listen attentively to their pleas. For example, in [Psalm 5:2](https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm) (BSB), "Attend to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray."

It can also refer to turning aside from a prescribed path, often with negative connotations of straying from God's commandments ([Deuteronomy 5:32](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-32.htm)).  
- The verb is used in various grammatical forms, including Qal, Hiphil, and Niphal, each adding nuance to its meaning. In the Qal form, it often describes a simple action of stretching or bending. The Hiphil form can imply causing something to be stretched or inclined, while the Niphal form may indicate a passive or reflexive action.
