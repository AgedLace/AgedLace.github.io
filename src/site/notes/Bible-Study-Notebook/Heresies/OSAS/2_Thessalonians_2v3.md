## Strong's Concordance

**Definition** - Apostasy, rebellion, defection, falling away

**Word Origin** - Derived from *ἀφίστημι* (*aphistēmi*), meaning "*to lead away*, *to depart*, *to fall away*.

**Usage** - The term *ἀποστασία* is used in the New Testament to describe **a departure from the faith** or a rebellion against established religious beliefs. It is often associated with **a significant turning away from God** and His teachings.

## Helps Word-studies

**646** *apostasía* (from [868](https://biblehub.com/greek/868.htm) */aphístēmi*, "leave, depart," which is derived from [575](https://biblehub.com/greek/575.htm) */apó*, "away from" and [2476](https://biblehub.com/greek/2476.htm) */histémi*, "stand")–properly, departure (implying *desertion*); *apostasy* –**literally, "a leaving, from a previous *standing*.**"


</div></div>


The Greek word for "rebellion" (or "falling away" in some translations) is *apostasia* which literally means "a leaving, from a previous standing."

One had to have been a believer at one time in order to later turn away from God and His teachings.

The false teaching that those who fall away were never really Christians just doesn't stand.

If they had never been a Christian, then there is nothing to fall away from.  

Only a one-time believer can fall away from the faith.
