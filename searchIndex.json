It is used to describe the faith that believers have in God and Jesus Christ, encompassing both intellectual assent and trustful commitment. &quot;Pistis&quot; is foundational to the Christian life, as it is through faith that believers are justified and live out their relationship with God.\nHelps Word-studies\n4102 pístis (from 3982_/peith__ô_, &quot;persuade, be persuaded&quot;) – properly, persuasion (be persuaded, come to trust); faith.\nFaith (4102_/pistis_) is always a gift from God, and never something that can be produced by people. In short, 4102_/pistis_ (&quot;faith&quot;) for the believer is &quot;God's divine persuasion&quot; – and therefore distinct from human belief (confidence), yet involving it. The Lord continuously births faith in the yielded believer so they can know what He prefers, i.e. the persuasion of His will (1 Jn 5:4).\n4102 (pistis) in secular antiquity referred to a guarantee (warranty). In Scripture, faith is God's warranty, certifying that the revelation He inbirthed will come to pass (His way).\nFaith (4102_/pistis_) is also used collectively – of all the times God has revealed (given the persuasion of) His will, which includes the full revelation of Scripture (Jude 3). Indeed, God the Lord guarantees that all of this revelation will come to pass! Compare Mt 5:18 with 2 Tim 3:16.]\n\nThe root of 4102_/pistis_ (&quot;faith&quot;) is 3982_/peith__ô_ (&quot;to persuade, be persuaded&quot;) which supplies the core-meaning of faith (&quot;divine persuasion&quot;). It is God's warranty that guarantees the fulfillment of the revelation He births within the receptive believer (cf. 1 Jn 5:4 with Heb 11:1).\n\nFaith (4102_/pistis_) is always received from God, and never generated by us.\nRo 12:3: &quot;For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith (4102_/pistis_)&quot; (NASU).\nEph 2:8,9: &quot; For by grace you have been saved through faith (4102_/pistis_); and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9not as a result of works, so that no one may boast&quot; (NASU).\nGal 5:22,23: &quot;22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,\npatience, kindness, goodness, faith (4102_/pistis_), 23gentleness,\nself-control; against such things there is no law.&quot;\n2 Thes 1:11: &quot;To this end (glorification) – indeed each time we pray about (peri) you for the purpose (hin) of our God counting you worthy of the call – even that He may fulfill (His) every good-pleasure that comes from (His) goodness and work of faith, in (His) ability.&quot;\nReflection: Faith is only (exclusively) given to the redeemed. It is not a virtue that can be worked up by human effort.\n\nFaith (4102_/pistis_) enables the believer to know God's preferred-will (cf. J. Calvin; see 2307_/thel__ç__ma_). Accordingly, faith (4102_/pistis_) and &quot;God's preferred-will (2307_/thel__ç__ma_)&quot; are directly connected in Scripture.\n\n2 Ro 12:2,3: &quot; And do not be conformed to this world, but betransformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will (2307_/thel__ç__ma_) of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. 3For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith (4102_/pistis_)&quot; (NASU).\n5 2 Cor 8:5,7: &quot; And this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will (2307_/thel__ç__ma_) of God&quot; (NASU).\n7&quot; But just as you abound in everything, in faith (4102_/pistis_)\nand utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, see that you abound in this gracious work also&quot; (NASU).\nHeb 10:36,38: &quot;36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will (2307_/thel__ç__ma_) of God, you may receive what was promised&quot; (NASU).\n&quot; BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH (4102_/pistis_); AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM&quot; (NASU).\n1 Jn 5:4: &quot;For whatever is born of God conquers the world; and this is the conquest that has conquered the world – our faith (4102_/pistis_).&quot;\n\nIn sum, faith (4102_/pistis_) is a persuasion from God that we receive as He grants impulse (&quot;divine spark&quot;; cf. the Heb hiphil form of believe, ***mn, in a later discussion). Faith is always the work of God and involves hearing His voice – whereby the believer lays hold of His preferred-will (cf. J. Calvin).\n\n1 Hab 2:1: &quot; I will stand on my guard post And station myself on the rampart; And I will keep watch to see what He will speak in (Heb b ) me&quot; (NASU).\nHab 2:4: &quot;Behold, as for the proud one, His soul is not right within him;\nBut the righteous will live in his faith&quot; (= 4102_/pistis_, &quot;faith from the Lord&quot;).\nMore On What Faith Is … And isn't\n\n**In Scripture, faith and belief are not exactly the same. Faith always comes from God and involves His revelation therefore faith is beyond belief!\n**\n\n**Faith is God's work; faith is never the work of people. We cannot produce faith ourselves, nor can we &quot;drum it up at will.&quot; Rather, faith comes as Christ speaks His rh__ç__ma-word within (see Ro 10:17, Gk text).\n**\n\n**In all of Scripture, only the term faith is ever used in the following way: Ro 14:23: Whatever is not of faith (4102_/pistis_) is sin.&quot; Heb 11:6: &quot;And without faith (4102_/pistis_) it is impossible to\n**\n\nplease Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him&quot; (NASU).\nReflection: Nothing quite like this two-fold witness appears elsewhere in the Bible. These sweeping statements sober the heart and inspire the soul!\nThe Lord offers to inbirth faith in each scene of life – so that each matters equally in eternity … no matter how insignificant they seem (Lk 16:10 with Lk 17:6 and 2 Pet 1:2).\nKey quotes\n&quot;Faith always pre-supposes revelation&quot; (W. H. Griffith Thomas, Genesis, 55). &quot;Faith is always a response to a divine revelation&quot; (W. H. Griffith Thomas, Hebrews, 143). &quot;Faith … both in its initiation and every step of the way, is Spirit given … faith is God given&quot; (W. Hendriksen, Galatians, 197). &quot;Faith precedes works, and is not something merely deduced by\nreason of existing&quot; (D. Edmond Hiebert, Thessalonians, 2 Thes 1:11). &quot;Faith is always a gift of God&quot; (L. Morris, John, p 520). &quot;The basis of faith is God's revelation of Himself … Christianity came\nto be seen as a faith event&quot; (O. Michel, Dictionary of New Testament Theology).\n&quot;Faith is the divine response, wrought in man, by God&quot; (from Berkof's Systematic Theology, representing the views of Barth and Brunner).\n&quot;Faith always has the element of assurance, certainty and confidence … and evidential value substantiating the thing we hope for … with faith, there is no strain or tension; rather, it has the element of assurance and confidence in it … if there is strain or tension … trying to persuade yourself to keep from doubting, you can be quite sure that it is not faith … faith is not the law of mathematical probability, … faith is not natural …faith is spiritual, the gift of God … you cannot command faith at will, faith is always something that is given-inwrought by God; … therefore, if you want to be a man of faith, it will always be the result of becoming a certain type of person&quot; (M. Lloyd Jones, Romans, Ro 4:18-25).\n&quot;Faith is the divinely given conviction of things unseen&quot; (Homer Kent Jr., Hebrews, 217, quoting Theological Dictionary of the NT vol 2, 476).\n&quot;Faith is the organ which enables people to see the invisible order&quot; (F.\nF. Bruce, Hebrews, 279).\n&quot;Faith is knowing what is His will toward us; therefore, we hold faith to be the knowledge of God's will toward us&quot; (John Calvin, as quoted by R. McAfee Brown in Is Faith Obsolete?).\n&quot;Right faith is a thing wrought in us by the Holy Spirit&quot; (Wm. Tyndale).\n&quot;We have made faith a condition of mind, when it is a divinely imparted grace of the heart … we can receive faith only as he gives it … you cannot manufacture faith, you can not work it up … you can believe a promise, and at the same time not have the faith to appropriate it … genuine, Scriptural faith is not our ability to 'count it done,' but is the deep consciousness divinely imparted to the heart of man that it is done, … it is the faith that only God can give … do not struggle in the power of the will … what a mistake to take our belief in God and call of faith … Christ, the living word, is our sufficiency … (Charles Price, The Real Faith, Logos/publications).\nNote: On the distinction between believing (belief), and faith in the Scriptures see Js 2:19; Jn 10:38; Ac 8:13, 26:27,28; Ro 14:2; 2 Thes 2:11; 1 Jn 4:1; also Jn 2:23, 7:31, 12:42 and 4102/pisteu__ô (&quot;believe&quot;).\nAs in the Gospels, a person's believing (belief) is vital (cf. Heb 11:6). But a personal encounter with Christ (a true connection with Him and His Word) is always necessary for believing (&quot;man's responsibility&quot;) to be transformed into faith (which is always and only God's word). See also Mt 8:10,13, 9:22,28,29, 15:28; Ac 20:21; Ro 9:32; Gal 3:9,22.\nSummary\nBelief and faith are not exactly equivalent terms. When Jesus told people, &quot;Your faith has made you well,&quot; faith was still His gift (Eph 2:8,9). Any gift however, once received, becomes the &quot;possession&quot; of the recipient. Faith however is always from God and is purely His work (2 Thes 1:11).\nNote: The Greek definite article is uniformly used in the expressions &quot;your faith,&quot; &quot;their faith&quot; (which occur over 30 times in the Greek NT). This genitive construction with the article refers to &quot;the principle of faith (operating in) you&quot; – not &quot;your faith&quot; in the sense that faith is ever generated by the recipient.\n[The meaning of the definite article in this construction is &quot;the principle of faith at work in you,&quot; &quot;the operating-principle of faith in them,&quot; etc. For examples see: Mt 9:2,22,29; Lk 17:19; Phil 2:17; 2 Pet 1:5, etc.]\nFaith (4102_/pistis_) involves belief but it goes beyond human believing because it involves the personal revelation (inworking) of God. Faith is always God's work. Our believing has eternal meaning when it becomes &quot;faith-believing&quot; by the transforming grace of God.\nReflection: Demons believe (and shudder) … but they do not have (experience) faith!\nJs 2:19: &quot;You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder&quot; (NASU).",

These things must happen, but the end is still to come.\n\nThe Beginning Of Birth Pains\n\nWars - Nation vs Nation; Kingdom vs Kingdom\nGlobal Famines\nGlobal Earthquakes\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:7-8\n7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.\n8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.\n\nLuke 21:11 adds …\n\nGlobal National Catastrophes and Plagues\nFearful Sights\nGreat Signs From Heaven\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:11\n11 There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven.\n\nThe More To Come\n\nArrest, Persecution, Killing of Christian Martyrs\nGlobal Hatred for Christians\nGlobal Turning Away From God\nRampant Betrayal and Hatred; Even by Family Members\nFalse Prophets\nMany Deceived\nGlobal Rampant Sin; Wickedness Multiplied\nLove Of Many Grows Cold\nGospel Preached To The Whole World\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:9-14\n9 THEN they will deliver you over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.\n10 AT THAT TIME many will fall away and will betray and hate one another,\n11 and many false prophets will arise and mislead many.\n12 Because of the multiplication of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold.\n13 But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.\n14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\n\nMark and Luke Expand On These Signs …\n\nDelivered Over to Councils and Beaten In Synagogues\nChristians Will Testify (Witness) Before Kings and Governors\nDivine Wisdom Given\nBetrayal by Close Family Members\nGlobal Hatred\n\n[!NOTE] Mark 13:9-13\n9 So be on your guard.

But for the sake of the elect, those days will be cut short.\n23 At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There He is!' do not believe it.\n24 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive even the elect, if that were possible.\n25 See, I have told you in advance.\n26 So if they tell you, 'There He is, in the wilderness,' do not go out, or, 'Here He is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.\n27 For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.\n28 Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.\n\nLuke 21 adds the following perspective …\n\nJerusalem Surrounded By Armies\nThe Days Of God's Vengeance In Order To Fulfill Prophecy\nDisaster In The Land (of Israel)\nGreat Distress Upon the Land\nWrath Upon the People\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:20-24\n20 But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near.\n21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city.\n22 For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.\n23 &quot;Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people;\n24 How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people.\n\nImmediately After The Tribulation\n\nSun Will Be Darkened\nMoon Will Give No Light\nStars Fall From Sky\nPowers In Heaven Shaken\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:29\n29 &quot;But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.\n\n[!NOTE] Mark 13:24-25\n24 But in those days, after that tribulation: 'The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;\n25 the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.'\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:25\n25 There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves.\n\nPlease compare Matthew 24:29, Mark 13:24-25, and Luke 21:25 with Revelation 6:12-14.\n\n[!NOTE] Revelation 6:12-14\n12 And I watched as the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair, and the whole moon turned blood red,\n13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth like unripe figs dropping from a tree shaken by a great wind.\n14 The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.\n\nTHEN The Sign Of The Son Of Man\n\nJesus' Sign Appears In The Heavens\nAll the Earth Will Mourn When They See Him\nJesus Comes On The Clouds of Heaven\nAngels Sent Out At Trumpet Blast\nThe Elect Are Gathered From The Heavens\n\nMatthew says, &quot;from one end of the heavens to the other&quot;\nMark says, &quot;from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heaven.&quot;\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:30-31\n30 At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\n31 And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.\n\n[!NOTE] Mark 13:26-27\n26 At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.\n27 And He will send out the angels to gather His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThese passages very clearly refute the false doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture. The gathering of Christ's Elect happens when He returns after the Great Tribulation of those days.\n\nLuke 21:26-27 adds …\n\nMen Fainting From Fear And Anxiety of What Is Coming\nPowers of the Heavens Will Be Shaken\nThey Will See Son of Man Coming In A Cloud\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:26-27\n26 Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.\n27 At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.\n\nWhat Jesus Said Our Attitude Should Be\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:28\n28 When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.&quot;\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/blog/2025/06-june/what-signals-jesus-return/\"> What Sign Signals Your Return - Part 2</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/blog/2025/06-june/when-will-all-this-happen/\"> When Will All This Happen - Part 3</a>",

So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.\n40 Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.\n41 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.\n\nMultiple Warnings\n\nKeep Watch\nBe Ready\nKeep On The Alert\nBe Dressed For Service (Have the Armor of God On)\nKeep Awake\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:42-44\n42 Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day on which your Lord will come.\n43 But understand this: If the homeowner had known in which watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.\n44 For this reason, you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.\n\n[!NOTE] Mark 13: 33-37\n32 No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\n33 Be on your guard and stay alert. For you do not know when the appointed time will come.\n34 It is like a man going on a journey who left his house, put each servant in charge of his own task, and instructed the doorkeeper to keep watch.\n35 Therefore keep watch, because you do not know when the master of the house will return—whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning.\n36 Otherwise, he may arrive without notice and find you sleeping.\n37 And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Keep watch!&quot;\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:35-38\n35 Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning.\n\nAdditional Warnings\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:45-51\n45 Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household, to give the others their food at the proper time?\n46 Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.\n47 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.\n48 But suppose that servant is wicked and says in his heart, 'My master will be away a long time.'\n49 And he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.\n50 The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate.\n51 Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:36-38\n36 Then you will be like servants waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks, they can open the door for him at once.\n37 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds on watch when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve and will have them recline at the table, and he himself will come and wait on them.\n38 Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them alert, those servants will be blessed.\n\n[!NOTE]\nNotice in Matthew there is both a blessing and a condemnation with respect to being alert and prepared for Jesus' return. Those who are alert and going about the business of the Kingdom will be blessed. While those who become lazy, and abusive of fellow believers will not only be surprised by Jesus' coming, but will suffer the same fate as unbelievers and hypocrites.\nAnd in Luke Jesus Himself will dress Himself to serve and will have those who endure until the end to recline at His table, and He will wait upon them. His blessing will be upon them.\n\nThis concludes our 3 part series of Jesus' End-Time Chronology.",

These 'discussions' have quite literally devolved into both sides name-calling, and even accusing the other of being &quot;antichrist&quot;.\nI have been praying and asking God about this. As I was waking up today, I had the thought how God has never called Christians &quot;to return&quot; to His land. Rather, He has brought back the biological descendants (yet another bitterly contested topic) of Abraham, just as He promised by covenant to him.\n\n[!NOTE] Genesis 12:7\n7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, &quot;I will give this land to your offspring.&quot; So Abram built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.\n\nIn the meantime, I am in the process of gathering my resources for diving into the question of &quot;<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Who Is Israel</a>?&quot;. It is a vast topic that will take a great deal of time to sift, and pray, through. I don't know when this new project will be completed, as I am also working on a series of posts aimed at new believers in Christ.\nI just wanted to get this revelation down so that I didn't forget it.\nOther Scriptures Reiterating God's Everlasting Covenant With Abraham And His Descendants\n\nGenesis 13:14-17\nGenesis 15:18-21\nGenesis 17:8\nGenesis 26:3-4\nGenesis 28:3-15\nGenesis 35:12\nExodus 6:7-8\nExodus 33:1\nDeuteronomy 34:4\nJoshua 1:2-4\nNehemiah 9:7-8\nPsalm 105:9-11\nActs 7:5\nRomans 4:13",

		"content": "Welcome To Be Not Deceived\nPrimary Purpose\nThe primary purpose of Be Not Deceived is to warn believers to fulfill Jesus' commands in Matthew 24:4-5, Luke 21:8, and Mark 13:5-6 &quot;to see to it that no one deceives&quot; them.\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:4-5\n4Jesus answered, &quot;See to it that no one deceives you. 5For many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many.\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:8\n8Jesus answered, &quot;See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am He,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.\n\n[!NOTE] Mark 13:5-6\n5Jesus began by telling them, &quot;See to it that no one deceives you. 6Many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am He,' and will deceive many.\n\nOne of the main reasons this is so important is Jesus said the end time deception would be so great that, if possible, would even deceive the elect.\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:23-24\n23 At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There He is!' do not believe it. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible.\n\nSecondary Purpose\nThe secondary purpose of Be Not Deceived is to prepare, equip, and build up believers so that they are able to fulfill Jesus' Command to 'Be Not Deceived'.\nOnly when believers are grounded in the Word will they not be deceived by the false prophets, false teachers, false christs, and great signs and wonders Jesus repeatedly warned of. They will know the truth, and, as Jesus said in John 8:31-32, &quot;If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free&quot;, including from deception.\nHow To Be Built Up So You Are Not Deceived\nThe Holy Spirit Is Our Teacher\n\n[!NOTE] John 14:26\n26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have told you.\n\nAll we need to do before reading the Holy Scriptures is ask the Holy Spirit to grant us His revelation, illumination, inspiration, insight and understanding of what the Word really says and means.\nThe Word Is God-breathed\n\n[!NOTE] 2 Timothy 3:16-17\n16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness,  17 so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.\n\nThe Holy Scriptures are able to keep us from being deceived if we diligently apply ourselves to learning what they say. We can be obedient to what Jesus has commanded us only if we know what He has commanded us.\nGod's Word Makes Wise\n\n[!NOTE] 2 Timothy 3:15\n15 From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.\n\nIf we are consistently, and prayerfully, reading and studying the Word of God, it will give us the wisdom to know when someone is preaching or teaching wrong doctrine. One who is trained in the real thing, will not be deceived by a counterfeit.\nGod's Word Builds Up\n\n[!NOTE] Acts 20:32\n32 And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.\n\n[!example] Prayer\nI commit you, my precious reader, to God and to the Word of His Grace, that it would indeed build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified; and that it would also keep and protect you from all deception of every kind; that you will know the truth so as to be free from all deception. In Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nWe Are Commanded To Build Ourselves Up\n\n[!NOTE] Jude 1:20-21\n20 But you, beloved, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,  21 keep yourselves in the love of God as you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you eternal life.\n\nAlso, take note of Ephesians 4:16 below, that Believers are to 'grow and build themselves up in love' as they do the work that God has assigned them to do.\nMinisters Are Given To Equip, Grow, And Build Up The Body\n\n[!NOTE] Ephesians 4:11-16\n11 And it was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,  12 to equip the saints for works of ministry and to build up the body of Christ,  13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ. 14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming.  15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ Himself, who is the head.  16 From Him the whole body, fitted and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love through the work of each individual part.\n\nTwo of the main responsibilities of ministers of the Gospel is to grow and build the Body of Christ up, and to equip them for works of ministry. ALL Believers are called to ministry; each as the Holy Spirit has gifted, and leads, them.\nConclusion\nBelievers will have no excuse about their ignorance or immaturity when they stand before Him on Judgment day. He has provided us the necessary tools to ensure that we are able to fulfill His command to &quot;see to it that no one deceives you.&quot;\n\nPLEASE NOTE\nThe entries in the Bible Study Notebook are a continual work in progress. They will be fleshed out and added to as we progress through the Holy Scriptures.",
