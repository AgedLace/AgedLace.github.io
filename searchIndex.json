		"content": "Welcome To Be Not Deceived\nPrimary Purpose\nThe primary purpose of Be Not Deceived is to warn believers to fulfill Jesus' commands in Matthew 24:4-5, Luke 21:8, and Mark 13:5-6 &quot;to see to it that no one deceives&quot; them.\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:4-5\n4Jesus answered, &quot;See to it that no one deceives you. 5For many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many.\n\n[!NOTE] Luke 21:8\n8Jesus answered, &quot;See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am He,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.\n\n[!NOTE] Mark 13:5-6\n5Jesus began by telling them, &quot;See to it that no one deceives you. 6Many will come in My name, claiming, 'I am He,' and will deceive many.\n\nOne of the main reasons this is so important is Jesus said the end time deception would be so great that, if possible, would even deceive the elect.\n\n[!NOTE] Matthew 24:23-24\n23 At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There He is!' do not believe it. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible.\n\nSecondary Purpose\nThe secondary purpose of Be Not Deceived is to prepare, equip, and build up believers so that they are able to fulfill Jesus' Command to 'Be Not Deceived'.\nOnly when believers are grounded in the Word will they not be deceived by the false prophets, false teachers, false christs, and great signs and wonders Jesus repeatedly warned of. They will know the truth, and, as Jesus said in John 8:31-32, &quot;If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free&quot;, including from deception.\nHow To Be Built Up So You Are Not Deceived\nThe Holy Spirit Is Our Teacher\n\n[!NOTE] John 14:26\n26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have told you.\n\nAll we need to do before reading the Holy Scriptures is ask the Holy Spirit to grant us His revelation, illumination, inspiration, insight and understanding of what the Word really says and means.\nThe Word Is God-breathed\n\n[!NOTE] 2 Timothy 3:16-17\n16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness,  17 so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.\n\nThe Holy Scriptures are able to keep us from being deceived if we diligently apply ourselves to learning what they say. We can be obedient to what Jesus has commanded us only if we know what He has commanded us.\nGod's Word Makes Wise\n\n[!NOTE] 2 Timothy 3:15\n15 From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.\n\nIf we are consistently, and prayerfully, reading and studying the Word of God, it will give us the wisdom to know when someone is preaching or teaching wrong doctrine. One who is trained in the real thing, will not be deceived by a counterfeit.\nGod's Word Builds Up\n\n[!NOTE] Acts 20:32\n32 And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.\n\n[!example] Prayer\nI commit you, my precious reader, to God and to the Word of His Grace, that it would indeed build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified; and that it would also keep and protect you from all deception of every kind; that you will know the truth so as to be free from all deception. In Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nWe Are Commanded To Build Ourselves Up\n\n[!NOTE] Jude 1:20-21\n20 But you, beloved, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,  21 keep yourselves in the love of God as you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you eternal life.\n\nAlso, take note of Ephesians 4:16 below, that Believers are to 'grow and build themselves up in love' as they do the work that God has assigned them to do.\nMinisters Are Given To Equip, Grow, And Build Up The Body\n\n[!NOTE] Ephesians 4:11-16\n11 And it was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,  12 to equip the saints for works of ministry and to build up the body of Christ,  13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ. 14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming.  15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ Himself, who is the head.  16 From Him the whole body, fitted and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love through the work of each individual part.\n\nTwo of the main responsibilities of ministers of the Gospel is to grow and build the Body of Christ up, and to equip them for works of ministry. ALL Believers are called to ministry; each as the Holy Spirit has gifted, and leads, them.\nConclusion\nBelievers will have no excuse about their ignorance or immaturity when they stand before Him on Judgment day. He has provided us the necessary tools to ensure that we are able to fulfill His command to &quot;see to it that no one deceives you.&quot;\n\nPLEASE NOTE\nThe entries in the Bible Study Notebook are a continual work in progress. They will be fleshed out and added to as we progress through the Holy Scriptures.",
